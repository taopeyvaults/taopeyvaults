        <h2>Taopey Vaults: an on-chain trading experiment</h2>
        <h3>Democratized AI meets Permissionless Trading</h3>
        <p>This is a very high-risk, real-time trading experiment, executing (non-backtested) trading strategies based off the BTC/ETH trading signals on Subnet #8 of the BITTENSOR NETWORK. This is purely for experimentation and fun to evaluate the signals generated by the network. Not financial advice.</p>
        <p>The experiment runs on PERPY FINANCE as it provides permissionless access to onchain liquidity with in-depth statistical insight on the experimental strategies. Using Perpy's unique non-custodial copy trading vaults, while anyone can gain exposure to this experiment in a permissionless manner, you're highly discouraged from doing so. By depositing funds in these vaults, you take 100% responsibility for your actions and acknowledge that you understand the risks and that you can lose 100% of the funds.</p>
